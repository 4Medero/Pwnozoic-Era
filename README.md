* **Decompilers**:
  - [angr](https://angr.io/) - angr is an open-source binary analysis platform for Python. It combines both static and dynamic symbolic ("concolic") analysis, providing tools to solve a variety of tasks.
  - [Binary Ninja](https://binary.ninja/) - Binary Ninja is an interactive decompiler, disassembler, debugger, and binary analysis platform built by reverse engineers, for reverse engineers.
  - [DogBolt](https://dogbolt.org/) - It is an interactive online decompiler which shows equivalent C-like output of decompiled programs from many popular decompilers.
  - [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) - Ghidra is a software reverse engineering (SRE) framework
  - [IDA](https://hex-rays.com/ida-free) - IDA is commonly used in software reverse engineering, assisting with malware analysis and vulnerability detection.
    
* **Libraries**:
  - [pwntools](https://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/) - pwntools is a CTF framework and exploit development library. Written in Python, it is designed for rapid prototyping and development, and intended to make exploit writing as simple as possible.
  - [r2pipe](https://github.com/radareorg/radare2-r2pipe) - Access radare2 via pipe from any programming language!
  - 
  - [capstone](https://www.capstone-engine.org) - Capstone disassembly/disassembler framework for ARM, ARM64 (ARMv8), Alpha, BPF, Ethereum VM, HPPA, LoongArch, M68K, M680X, Mips, MOS65XX, PPC, RISC-V(rv32G/rv64G), SH, Sparc, SystemZ, TMS320C64X, TriCore, Webassembly, XCore and X86.
  - [struct](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html) - This module converts between Python values and C structs represented as Python bytes objects.
  - [sockets](https://docs.python.org/es/3/library/socket.html) - This module provides access to the BSD socket interface. It is available on all modern Unix systems, Windows, MacOS, and probably additional platforms.
