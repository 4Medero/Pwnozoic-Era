With the x86 elf architecture, arguments are passed on the stack. Also one thing as you may know, in C function can return a value. In x64, this value is passed in the `rax` register. In x86 this value is passed in the `eax` register.

Also one thing, there are different sizes for registers. These typical sizes we will be dealing with are 8 bytes, 4 bytes, 2 bytes, and 1. The reason for these different sizes is due to the advancement of technology, we can store more data in a register.
